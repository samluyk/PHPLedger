# PHPLedger

This program was created to be a digital ledger that allows me to store and categorize all the money I make and spend, and save it in a database for logging purposes and visualization via the open source project Metabase.

This is meant only to run locally to help compensate for my lack of proper code/best practice knowledge. You should do the same.

The idea for this was based off of this linked google sheet/form. I was hoping for similar functionality, just fully self-hostable.
