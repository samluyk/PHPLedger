# PHPLedger

This program is meant to categorize and log every penny made and spent, and store it in a database for logging purposes and future visualization. 

It is unique to my own personal situation but can be adapted to fit other use cases.


### Requirements:
- wampserver3.1.9 or the following
- php 7.2.18
- mysqli 5.7.26
- apache2
- phpmyadmin

### To do:
- ~~finalize categories~~
- break up fixed/variable expenses in code
- define array as ints not strings
- less ugly front end/use external css
- separate file for database credentials
- success/failure messages
- database backend to store the data
- GUI to query the database
- documentation
- encryption
