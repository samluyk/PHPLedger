This program is meant to categorize and log every penny made and spent, and store it in a database for logging purposes and future visualization. 

It is unique to my own personal situation but can be adapted to fit other use cases.

- php 7.2.18

### To do:
- ~~finalize categories~~
- break up fixed/variable expenses
- ~~less ugly front end~~

- postgresql backend to store the data
- import data to the database
- GUI to query the database
