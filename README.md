This program is meant to categorize and log every penny made and spent, and store it in a database for logging purposes and future visualization. 

It is unique to my own personal situation but can be adapted to fit other use cases.


### Requirements:
- php
- mysqli
- apache2
- phpmyadmin

### To do:
- finalize categories
- break up fixed/variable expenses
- less ugly front end/use external css
- separate file for database
- success/failure messages
- database backend to store the data
- GUI to query the database
- documentation
- encryption
